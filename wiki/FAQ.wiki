===What Linux Filesystem should I use for my rip-containers ?===
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===                            ====
 * At least the container should be very big.(more than just a few GB)
 * With linux you have the choice between : ext2,ext3,ext4,xfs and reiserfs. I would choose xfs.
===                            ====
===                            ====
===I do not like the the default place /dvdrip to store my videos ?===
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===                            ====
 * By default 3 directorys inside the */* root-fs are created
 * */dvdrip/iso*
 * */dvdrip/dvd*
 * */dvdrip/bluray* 
== == 
 * You can replace this 3 directorys to any directory you like to do.
== ==
 * No spaces " " inside the direcory-name.
 * The 3 directorys you have chosen must be writeable with your current xbmc-user.
 * Change the addon settings to your desired directorys.
