===What is the Rescue-copy?===
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===                            ====
 * A clean dvd-filesystem copy can be made with dd without any problem as long the css of the inserted dvd is open and dvd-filesystem has no erorrs.
 * I guess most of the dvd's purchased prior to 2005 are not "crippled dvd's"
 * After 2005 the big players from hollywood began to sell "crippled dvd's". This kind of dvd's can be played on allmost all players but are copy protected.
 * With a copy protected dvd it can be very hard to produce a backup with dd or to transcode with handbrake.
 * The rescue-copy mode use ddresque to copy instead of dd.

===I have several of this timeout-errors or could not read errors. What should I do ?===
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===                            ====
 * With the relese 0.6.14 I do add a few settings to be more flexible.

 * Prior to release 0.6.14 I made the timeout hard-coded inside the code like the following example.
{{{
    WCycles = 3
    Waitexit = True
    while (Waitexit):
           if (os.path.exists(__configLinux__[30])):
               if (__verbose__ == 'true'):
                   OSlog("state-files exist ...")
               Waitexit = False
           else:
               WCycles = WCycles + 1
               time.sleep(1)
           if (WCycles >= 20):
               if (__verbose__ == 'true'):
                   OSlog("Timeout 20 secounds reached for track-file  ...")
                   OSlog("increase timeout value on line 362 / Linux.py  ...")
               xbmc.executebuiltin("Dialog.Close(busydialog)")
               return 2

}}}
 * In release 0.6.14 all timeout-parts are removed and will be replaced with a value from the settings.
 
 * Increase the timeout a few-secounds and test again.

===What Linux Filesystem should I use for my rip-containers ?===
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===                            ====

===To run makemkvcon do I neeed to purchase a licence-key  ?===
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===                            ==== 
  * No . As long makemkv remains beta there will allways be a key to onbtain here (http://www.makemkv.com/forum2/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=1053)

  * If you receive the Message "Licence-key for makemkv expired" inside the addon You have to replace your current licence-key with a valid-key.

You can set the licence key here :
{{{
user@xbmcdev:~$ cd .MakeMKV/
user@xbmcdev:~/.MakeMKV$ ls -al
total 16
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root   26 2010-07-10 18:01 .
drwxr-xr-x 45 user user 8192 2010-08-23 21:58 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 root root  187 2010-08-23 20:57 settings.conf
user@xbmcdev:~/.MakeMKV$ 
}}}

Inside the file settings.conf the licence key can be updated or deleted.
