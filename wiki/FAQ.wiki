===What Linux Filesystem should I use for my rip-containers ?===
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===                            ====
 * At least the container should be very big.(more than just a few GB)
 * With linux you have the choice between : ext2,ext3,ext4,xfs and reiserfs. I would choose xfs.

===Could the rip-containers be placed inside a NAS ?===

===                            ====
 * Yes . Configure /etc/fstab to mount the NAS at booting.
