===What Linux Filesystem should I use for my rip-containers ?===
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===                            ====
 * At least the container should be very big.(more than just a few GB)
 * With linux you have the choice between : ext2,ext3,ext4,xfs and reiserfs. I would choose xfs.

===Could the rip-containers be placed inside a NAS ?===
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===                            ====
 * Yes . Configure /etc/fstab to mount the NAS at booting.

===I only a have dvd-drive. Can I use this addon without a blueray ?==
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===                            ====
 * Yes. For this reason I plan to implement a function to enable / disable all bluray functions inside the setting with a radio-button.
===                            ====
===                            ====
===Is this script running only on Ubuntu based systems ?==
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===                            ==== 
  * No. But I can only provide debian packages for handbrake and makekmkv.
  * If you would send me the 2 packages in a other format (rpm as exmaple) I can store them inside the script. If you would also send me a new setup.sh for your Linux would be great.(I guess you have to send 32 and 64 Bit releases...)
===   ===
===   === 
===Could the provided shell-scripts be replaced with own scripts ?==
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===                            ==== 
  * Yes. You can replace the shell-scripts with allmost all that is running on linux.
  * You have to use the API of this addon to be compatible.

===I would like to improve the addon with patches. What should I do ?===
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===                            ==== 
  * I only accept svn diff patches against the current trank.
  * If your diff contains binary exectuable files the full source-code of this included files  must be within the  diff-file or the patch will not be integrated.

===The addon speaks only English. Could my own native language be added ?===
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===                            ==== 
  * send me a diff-file
