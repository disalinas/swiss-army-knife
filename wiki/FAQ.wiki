===What Linux Filesystem should I use for my rip-containers ?===
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===                            ====
 * At least the container should be very big.(more than just a few GB)
 * With linux you have the choice between : ext2,ext3,ext4,xfs and reiserfs. I would choose xfs.

===Could the rip-containers be placed inside a SAN ?===

 * Yes . But you need to make a entry for the nas inside /etc/fstab to be shure that the 
nas after booting is mountet.
