Readme.Linux for xbmc addon swiss-army-knife  
--------------------------------------------

1.0 Welcome to my first addon swiss-army-knife

Please do excuse my poor writen english. My native language 
is german and I do speak a few others imho very good, but speaking 
and writing are two completly diffrent things.If you would would like to
improve the addon with your own language , patches are allways welcome.
 
As you may know until now, we had a few things inside xbmc like
 
* Scripts
* Programs 
* Plugins for Video 
* Plugins for Music
and many more 

After the release xbmc version 10.5 or higher anything is called a addon.
I used the switch to to the new addon-system  to make complete rewrite  of  
the old code from my previous script called "luemmels-dvd-ripper".
My old script was running .... but had a few down-sides...

- it was very huge ... and btw my first ever written python script.
- No support for blurays. 
- all code for os and gui was in a single file.
- it was hard to debug ..... and maintain.
- I had no subversion controll for the script.
- I was running on windows and linux. 

By this new addon I changed a few things.

1.) There are 3 strict seperated parts ( GUI / OS / shell-script)
2.) The code looks nicer .-)
3.) The code is easyer to maintain.   
4.) Subversion is now a important part of my work during the development of this 
    addon .... (and saved my ass one time ;-))
5.) For someone who wants to port the addon to windows or mac the work is easyer. 
    Please feel free to send patches for windows and mac.
    I do not use xbmc on this operating systems and I have therefore no intention 
    do portinbg this addon by myself.


1.1 What are the functions this addon provides ? 

* create a exact iso copy of a dvd with dd.
* try to copy crippled dvd's with ddrescue.
* convert dvd to a h264 container. 
* convert bluray to a mkv container.
* In a later release I plan to work  some of this features over the network. 


2.) Requierements for this addon 

- a Ubuntu 10.04 LTS system or higher. 
- a SVN build of XBMC (at least SVN 31953) or higher.
- a DVD-drive and optional a bluray if you would like to transcode BD-disk
- a place where you can store ripps. Be prepared that this place must be very very 
  big. 

3.0 What Software will be installed ? 

The list is to long but you can have a look inside the file 
shell-linux/setup.sh 

4.0 Where is the livcd.sh shell-script gone ? 

The replacement is called setup.sh and is inside the shell-linux 
directory.


5.) Upgrade from a previous version 

Please do remove any previous version of the addon including the addon-directory
inside user-data. As long the addon remains alpha a lot changes do occur.   

6.) Installation 

At first you have to extract the addon-zip inside the right place.

~/.xbmc/addons

Change to the shell-linux directory inside tha addon.

cd ~/.xbmc/addons/script.video.swiss.army.knife/shell-linux

Run the following command as user root :

./setup.sh xbmc

As long the eula is not accepted the script do not change any 
settings of the system.

If your user name for the linux-system is something other than 
xbmc, replace xbmc with your own username.(hint -> whoami[enter])
   
This shell-scripts do install all software for the addon 
including  2 debian files.

- It creates all directorys for ripping and transcoding 
- It will prepare the ssh-server and client to login without 
  any password.
- Depend on your system handbrake and makemkv are installed
  (32 or 64 bit).
- Multiple parts of the script do now ask if they should be executed.
- By this you can later run setup.sh and only execute the needed part 
  again.
 
This debian-filea are only tested on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.If you don't use 
a debian based system or your system is to old, you have to compile 
this 2 packages for yourself. The full-source of the 2 packages  is provided 
only on the project-page.

http://swiss-army-knife.googlecode.com/files/makekmkv_1.5.8.src.tar.gz
http://swiss-army-knife.googlecode.com/files/Handbrake-0.9.4-src.tar.gz

The next step to running this addon is to complete the setup with valid 
settings over xbmc. Open the xbmc addon-manager and enable the addon, if you 
did not allready.
Do change the settings to your needs like ...

* the place where to store your iso copys
* the directory to store the dvd transcoding files
* the directory to store the bluray mkv files
* the directory to store vob's  
* the directory to store over the network
* the user for the ssh communication
* Enable or disable some functions

and many more .....

6.1 Licence key for makekmv 

* Get a valid licence key for makemkv 
 
http://www.makemkv.com/forum2/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=1053

* Start makemkv an do the following :

-> Help -> Register -> new code from above link

If the addon finds a retired licence-key the addon bluray-functions
are completly disabled. You must renew your makemmkv-licence key !!!
 
Little Tip:

Do set the computer to a previous date and do set a new key :-) 

Do not try to remove the makemkv files and reinstall them.


6.2 What should you do if you have a error ? 

- Be sure to read the logs ...
- Be sure that the ssh-communication is correct (test ssh-communication) inside 
  the addon.
- Check the permissions of the shell-script folder. 
- Check the permissions of the data-containers. 
- Have a cool drink ;-)
- Have a look into the F.A.Q (http://code.google.com/p/swiss-army-knife/wiki/FAQ)
- I also recommand to test the shell-functions inside a terminal with your current 
  user.
