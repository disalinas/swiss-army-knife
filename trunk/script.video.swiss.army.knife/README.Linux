Readme.Linux for xbmc addon swiss-army-knife  
--------------------------------------------

1.0 Welcome to my first addon swiss-army-knife

Please do excuse my poor writen english. My native language 
is german and I do speak a few others imho very good, but speaking 
and writing are two completly diffrent things.If you would would like to
improve the addon with your own language , patches are allways welcome.
(Especialy to remove this typos from english) 

As you may know until now, we had a few things inside xbmc like
 
* Scripts
* Programs 
* Plugins for Video 
* Plugins for Music
and many more 

After the release xbmc version 10.0 or higher anything is called a addon.
I used the switch to to the new addon-system  to make complete rewrite  of  
the old code from my previous script called "luemmels-dvd-ripper".
My old script was running .... but had a few down-sides...

- it was very huge ... and btw my first ever written python script.
- No support for blurays. 
- all code for os and gui was in a single file.
- it was hard to debug ..... and maintain.
- I had no subversion controll for the script.
- It was running on windows and linux but it was a pain to maintain both 
  releases. 

By this new addon I changed a few things.

1.) There are 3 strict seperated parts ( GUI / OS / shell-script)
2.) The code looks nicer .-)
3.) The code is easyer to maintain.   
4.) Subversion is now a important part of my work during the development of this 
    addon .... (and saved my ass one time ;-))
5.) For someone who wants to port the addon to windows or mac the work is easyer. 
    Please feel free to send patches for windows and mac.
    If you decide to port this addon to windows please be aware that 
    binarys for 32 and 64 bits have to be build.
    I do not use xbmc on this operating systems and I have therefore no intention 
    do portinbg this addon by myself.


1.1 What are the functions this addon provides ? 


* create a exact iso copy of a dvd with dd.
* try to copy crippled dvd's with ddrescue.
* convert dvd to a h264 container. 
* convert bluray to a mkv container.
* convert dvd to a mkv container.
* convert dvd to iphone compatible format.

2.) Requierements for this addon 

- a Ubuntu 10.04 LTS system or higher. (Test passed on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS) 
- a SVN build of XBMC (at least SVN 31953) or higher.
- a DVD-drive and optional a bluray if you would like to transcode BD-disk
- a place where you can store ripps. Be prepared that this place must be very 
  big. 

3.0 What Software will be installed ? 

The list is to long but you can have a look inside the file 
shell-linux/setup.sh 

4.0 Where is the livcd.sh shell-script gone ? 

The replacement is called setup.sh and is inside the shell-linux 
directory.


5.) Upgrade from a previous version 

Please do remove any previous version of the addon including the addon-directory
inside user-data. As long the addon remains alpha or beta a lot of changes do occur. 

Very-Import as long this Addon is only ALPHA or BETA !!!!!

ALLWAYS RUN THE SETUP PROGRAMM INSIDE THE LINUX-SHELL FOLDER !!!
ALLWAYS REMOVE THE ADDON-FILES INCLUDING ADDON-DIRECTORY PRIOR 
TO INSTALL A NEW VERSION OF THIS ADDON.

6.) Installation 

At first you have to extract the addon-zip inside the right place.

~/.xbmc/addons

If you did install this addon over the luxeria-repository then this 
step was allready made for you.

Change to the shell-linux directory inside tha addon.

cd ~/.xbmc/addons/script.video.swiss.army.knife/shell-linux

Run the following command as user root :

./setup.sh xbmc

If you do not run setup.sh the following messages comes up on
starting the addon.

"Prior to run this addon setup.sh must be executed" 

Only after the execution of setup.sh this message never comes again.
Please do read the instructions carefully.
 
As long the eula is not accepted the script do not change any 
settings of the system.

If you are not using a stable release of this addon you see the 
following message .....

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The EULA-FILE can not be downloaded and therefore you must
use a svn release of this addon.
You do this at you own risk .....
the last stable puplic released version was 0.6.14

press any key to continue or ctrl-c to abort..
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

If your user name for the linux-system is something other than 
xbmc, replace xbmc with your own username.(hint -> whoami[enter])
   
This shell-scripts do install all software for the addon 
including  2 debian files.

- It checks that the shell is /bin/bash.
- It checks that user root is running the script.
- It creates all directorys for ripping and transcoding 
- It will prepare the ssh-server and client to login without 
  any password.
- Depend on your system handbrake and makemkv are installed
  (32 or 64 bit).
- If you plan to transcode dvd to mkv you have to install makemkv.
- The script do check if handbrake or makemkv are allready installed.
- The script do check witch versions of the tools makemkv and handbrake 
  are installed.
- If a error is detected during the installation of makemkv or handbrake 
  the script do exit now.
- Multiple parts of the script do now ask if they should be executed.
- By this you can later run setup.sh and only execute the needed part 
  again.
 
After release 0.6.15 a deinstall.sh script is provided to uninstall all 
software that was installed during the execution of setup.sh 
This script do not remove any folder from the movie-containers !

This debian-files for download  are only tested on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.If you don't use 
a debian based system, or your system is to old, you have to compile 
this 2 packages for yourself. The full-source of the 2 packages  is provided 
on the project-page to minimize the download-size.

http://swiss-army-knife.googlecode.com/files/makemkv_1.6.1.src.tar.gz
http://swiss-army-knife.googlecode.com/files/Handbrake-0.9.4-src.tar.gz

The next step to running this addon is to complete the setup with valid 
settings over xbmc. Open the xbmc addon-manager and enable the addon, if you 
did not allready.
Do change the settings to your needs like ...

* the place where to store your iso copys
* the directory to store the dvd transcoding files
* the directory to store the bluray mkv files
* the directory to store vob's  
* the directory to store the files over the network
* the directory to store the psp and iphone transcode files
* the user for the ssh communication
* Internal timeout values for the shell-scripts
* Enable or disable some functions

and many more .....

6.1 Licence key for makekmv 

* Get a valid licence key for makemkv 
 
http://www.makemkv.com/forum2/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=1053

* Start makemkv an do the following :

-> Help -> Register -> new code from above link

If the addon finds a retired licence-key the addon bluray-functions
are completly disabled. You must renew your makemmkv-licence key !!!
 
Do set the computer to a previous date and do set a new key inside the gui :-) 
or do edit this file over the commandline ....

user@xbmcdev:~$ cd .MakeMKV/
user@xbmcdev:~/.MakeMKV$ ls -al
total 16
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root   26 2010-07-10 18:01 .
drwxr-xr-x 45 user user 8192 2010-08-23 21:58 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 root root  187 2010-08-23 20:57 settings.conf
user@xbmcdev:~/.MakeMKV$ 

On my personal notebook this file looks like here .....

user@xbmcdev:~/.MakeMKV$ cat settings.conf 
#
# MakeMKV settings file, written by MakeMKV v1.6.1 linux(x86-release)
#

app_Key = "T-Sitx5LxEXqP3UVcXWEbszE4Aj24b2k1XXGvAWFqXb5P11X42ECO_e2UpLcjS^6EaS@"
app_UpdateLastCheck = "14882"

user@xbmcdev:~/.MakeMKV$ 

Of course the above key is not valid for makemkv.

Pleas do not try to remove the makemkv files and reinstall them.

If your licence key is expired you see the following message inside the addon

"Licence-key for makemkv expired"

6.2 What should you do if you have found a error ? 

- Be sure to read the logs ...
- This addons write all logs to the xbmc.log inside ~/temp/xbmc.log.
- Be sure to have verbose log activated inside the settings.
- By default this mode is activated.
- Be sure that the ssh-communication is correct (test ssh-communication) inside 
  the addon.
- Check the permissions of the shell-script folder. 
- Check the permissions of the data-containers. 
- Have a cool drink ;-)
- Have a look into the F.A.Q (http://code.google.com/p/swiss-army-knife/wiki/FAQ)
- I also recommand to test the shell-functions inside a terminal with your current 
  user.

- To collect all logs that are needed I created a little script inside the tool folder.

6.4 Bugtracking 

http://code.google.com/p/swiss-army-knife/issues/list

6.5 First steps with the addon 

If you are starting the addon the first time you see 5 Menu-Entrys.

1. Transcode BluRay to MKV
2. Transcode DVD
3. Expert-Mode
4. Job-Controll
5. Exit


1. Transcode BluRay to MKV
---------------------------

As the name suggest we transcode a bluray to a mkv-container with this 
menu-point. All you have to do is to insert a bluray disc into device 
specified inside the settings and press the button.

All bluray transcoding parameters are not asked because this menu-point assumes 
the following:

- The longest movie on the bluray-disk will be converted to mkv.
- All audio languages from the track will be converted 
- The produced file will be stored by default on the directory /dvdrip/bluray  

If you would to have more controll where to store the file you must use the expert-mode.


2. Transcode DVD
-----------------

As it says it will transcode a dvd.The format under wich the transcoded file will be stored
is depend from the settting : Default transcoding (dvd) 

We have the following choices:

Format choosen 			Default directory to store the generated file(s)

-> 264-high			/dvdrip/dvd 		
-> iso				/dvdrip/iso	
-> h264-low                     /dvdrip/transcode 
-> mkv                          /dvdrip/transcode 
-> vobcopy                      /dvdrip/vobcopy  
-> mpeg2                        /dvdrip/transcode    
-> iphone                       /dvdrip/portable/ip
-> psp                          /dvdrip/portable/psp

What format you chose is up to you .....

If you like a 1:1 copy select iso
If you wish a high quality take h264-high
If the rip should be very fast take h264-low
If you like to watch a dvd with huble-teleskop resolution use psp :-) 
 
By default I set the transcode profile to h264-high.
The longest track will be ripped or transcoded automatic. 

The default languages and subtitles are defined from the addon-settings.
You can chose up to 2 audio-languages and 1 subtitle.


6.6 User-Functions (up to 9 shell-scripts)
