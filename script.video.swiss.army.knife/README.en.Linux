Readme.Linux for XBMC addon swiss-army-knife 0.6.19 (Beta 4) 
------------------------------------------------------------

1.0 Welcome to my first addon called swiss-army-knife
-----------------------------------------------------

Hi, my name is Hans.  My native language is German. I do speak a few other
languages, but speaking and writing are two different things. I am having help
to write this help file and all the other translations that the system supports.
If you would would like to improve the addon with your own language, patches are 
always welcome.  I'd really like someone to write this readme in French as well.

Until V10.0 (dharma) version of XBMC we had a collection of different types of 
object within XBMC
 
* Scripts
* Programs 
* Plugins for Video 
* Plugins for Music
and many more 

After the release XBMC version 10.0 or higher everyting is now called an addon.
I used the switch to the new addon-system to make a complete rewrite  of  
the old code from my previous script called "luemmels-DVD-ripper".
My old script was running, but had a few down-sides...

- it was very huge ... and BTW my first ever written python script.
- No support for Blurays. 
- all code for the OS and GUI was in a single file.
- it was hard to debug ..... and maintain.
- I had no subversion control for the script.
- It was running on windows and Linux but it was a pain to maintain both 
  releases. 

For this new addon I changed a few things.

1.) There are 3 strict separated parts ( GUI / OS / shell-script)
2.) The code looks nicer .-)
3.) The code is easier to maintain.   
4.) Subversion is now a important part of my work during the development of this 
    addon .... (and saved my ass one time ;-))
5.) For someone who wants to port the addon to Windows or Mac the work is easier. 
    Please feel free to send patches for Windows and Mac.
    If you decide to port this addon to Windows please be aware that binaries 
    for 32 and 64 bit architectures have to be build.
    I don't use XBMC on Windows and I have therefore no intention porting this 
    addon myself.


1.1 What are the functions this addon provides ? 
-------------------------------------------------

* create a exact ISO copy of a DVD using the dd program.
* try to copy crippled DVD's with ddrescue.
* convert DVD to a h264 container. 
* convert Bluray to a MKV container.
* convert DVD to a MKV container.
* convert DVD to iPhone compatible format.
* convert DVD to PSP compatible format. 
* execute up to 9 user-defined shell-scripts.
* in a later release I plan to work  some of this features over the network. 


2.0 Requirements for this addon 
-------------------------------

- a Ubuntu 10.04 LTS system or higher. (Test passed on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS). This 
  System can be 32 or 64 bit. 
- a SVN build of XBMC (at least SVN 31953) or higher.
- a DVD drive and optionally a Bluray drive if you want to transcode BD-disk
- a place where you can store rips. Be prepared, ripping DVD and Bluray disks
  can take a very large amount of space (terrabyte disk drive prices are coming
  down though.) 

3.0 What Software will be installed ? 
-------------------------------------

The list is very long but you can have a look inside the file 
shell-Linux/setup.sh 


4.0 Where is the livcd.sh shell-script gone ? 
---------------------------------------------
The replacement is called setup.sh and is inside the shell-Linux 
directory.


5.0 Upgrade from a previous version 
-----------------------------------

Please do remove any previous version of the addon including the addon-directory
inside user-data. As long the addon remains alpha or beta a lot of changes do 
occur. 

Very important - as long this Addon is only ALPHA or BETA !!!!!

ALLWAYS RUN THE SETUP PROGRAM INSIDE THE LINUX-SHELL FOLDER !!!
ALLWAYS REMOVE THE ADDON FILES INCLUDING ADDON DIRECTORY PRIOR 
TO INSTALLATION OF A NEW VERSION OF THIS ADDON.

6.0 Installation 
----------------

At first you have to extract the addon-zip inside the right place.

~/.xbmc/addons

If you did install this addon over the luxeria-repository then this 
step was already made for you.

Change to the shell-Linux directory inside the addon.

cd ~/.xbmc/addons/script.video.swiss.army.knife/shell-Linux

Run the following command as user root :

./setup.sh xbmc

or use sudo, i.e.
sudo ./setup.sh xbmc

[Replace xbmc in this command line with the name that XBMC is running under if 
it is not the default 'xbmc'] (hint -> whoami[enter])

If you fail to run setup.sh the following messages comes up on starting the 
addon.

"You must run setup.sh prior to starting this addon for the first time" 

and you will not be able use the addon.

The first thing that the script will do is to download the End User License 
Agreement (EULA) and ask yo to accept its conditions. If you do not accepted the
conditions, the script will not carry out any further actions.

If you are not using a stable release of this addon you will see the
following message .....

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The EULA-FILE can not be downloaded and therefore you must
use a SVN release of this addon.
You do this at you own risk .....
the last stable public released version was 0.6.15

press any key to continue or ctrl-c to abort..
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This shell-scripts will install all software for the addon including 2 Debian 
files.

- It checks that the shell is /bin/bash.
- It checks that user root is running the script.
- It creates all directories for ripping and transcoding 
- It will prepare the ssh-server and client to login without 
  any password.
- Depending on your system handbrake is installed (32 or 64 bit).
- You will be given the opportunity to install all the dependencies for Makemkv.
  Only do this if you want Makemkv installed for Bluray ripping and transcoding
  of DVD and Bluray files to MKV format files.  The script will install binary
  versions of the two Makemkv distribution files (bin and oss).  You will need
  to register it and/or install the registration key.
- The script will check if handbrake or Makemkv are already installed.
- The script will check which versions of the tools Makemkv and handbrake 
  are installed.
- If a error is detected during the installation of Makemkv or handbrake 
  the script will exit now.
- Multiple parts of the script will now ask if they should be executed.
  - This means that you can later rerun setup.sh to carry out just the actions
    you need to carry out.
 
As of release 0.6.15, a deinstall.sh script is provided to uninstall all 
software that was installed during the execution of setup.sh.
- the script will not remove SSH
- this script do not remove any folders from the movie-containers !

This Debian-files for download  are only tested on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.If you don't
use a Debian based system, or your system is to old, you have to compile 
these 2 packages for yourself. The full-source of the 2 packages  is provided 
on the project-page to minimize the download-size.

http://swiss-army-knife.googlecode.com/files/Makemkv_1.6.5.src.tar.gz
http://swiss-army-knife.googlecode.com/files/Handbrake-0.9.4-src.tar.gz

(Please note, we try to keep up to date with the releases of these programs, so 
the exact version number may change.)

The next step to running this addon is to complete the setup with valid 
settings for XBMC. Open the XBMC addon-manager and enable the addon, if you 
did not already.

Now change the settings to your requirements ...

* the place where to store your ISO copies
* the directory to store the DVD transcoding files
* the directory to store the Bluray MKV files
* the directory to store VOB's  
* the directory to store the files over the network
* the directory to store the PSP and iPhone transcode files
* the user for the ssh communication
* Internal timeout values for the shell-scripts
* Enable or disable some functions

and many more .....

Have a look to APPENDIX A.) to see all configurations-settings.

6.1 License key for Makemkv 
---------------------------

* Get a valid license key for Makemkv 
 
http://www.makemkv.com/forum2/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=1053

* Start Makemkv and do the following :

-> Help -> Register -> new code from above link

Either set the computer to a previous date or set a new key inside the GUI :-)
If you don't have  a window manager installedon your XBMC machine you can use 
SSH to redirect X11 to a machine with one running;
on client machine type

ssh xbmc@192.168.0.5 -X

(replace username and ip address with your local settings) 
logon as normal and then start makeMKV

makemkv

This should start MakeMKV in a window on your client machine.
 
Alternatively you can manually edit the MakeMKV config file

cd ~/.MakeMKV/
nano settings.conf

On my personal notebook this file looks like this .....

user@xbmcdev:~/.MakeMKV$ cat settings.conf 
#
# MakeMKV settings file, written by MakeMKV v1.6.1 Linux(x86-release)
#

app_Key = "T-Sitx5LxEXqP3UVcBBbszE4Aj24b2k1XXGvAWFqXb5P11X42ECO_e2UpLcjS^6EaS@"
app_UpdateLastCheck = "14882"

Of course the above key is not a valid for Makemkv.
Please do not try to remove the Makemkv files and reinstall them.
If your license key is expired you see the following message inside the addon

"License-key for Makemkv expired"

If the addon finds a retired license-key the addon Bluray-functions are 
completely disabled. You must renew your Makemkv-license key !!!
 

6.2 What should you do if you find an a error ? 
-----------------------------------------------

- Be sure to read the logs ...
- This addons write all logs to the XBMC log inside ~/.xbmc/temp/xbmc.log.
- All ssh-communication is logged to ~/swiss.army.knife/ssh/output
- Be sure to have verbose log activated inside the settings. By default this 
  mode is activated.
- Be sure that the ssh-communication is correct (test ssh-communication) inside 
  the addon.
- Check the permissions of the shell-script folder. 
- Check the permissions of the data-containers. 
- Have a cool drink ;-)
- Have a look into the F.A.Q (http://code.google.com/p/swiss-army-knife/wiki/FAQ)
- I also recommend to test the shell-functions inside a terminal with your 
  current user.
  
  http://code.google.com/p/swiss-army-knife/wiki/LinuxShell

- To collect all logs that are needed I created a little script inside the tools
  folder called collect-log.sh

6.4 Bug tracking 
---------------

6.5 First steps with the addon 
------------------------------

Starting the addon for the first time you will see 5 menu entries.

1. Transcode Bluray to MKV
2. Transcode DVD
3. Expert Mode
4. Job Control
5. Exit


1. Transcode Bluray to MKV
---------------------------

As the name suggest we transcode a Bluray to a MKV-container with this 
menu option. All you have to do is to insert a Bluray disc into device 
specified inside the settings and press the button.

All Bluray transcoding parameters are not asked because this menu option assumes 
the following:

- The longest movie on the Bluray-disk will be converted to MKV.
- All audio languages from the track will be converted 
- The produced file will be stored by default on the directory /dvdrip/Bluray  

If you would to have more control where to store the file you must use 
Expert Mode.


2. Transcode DVD
-----------------

As it says it will transcode a DVD. The format under which the transcoded file 
will be stored is depend from the setting : Default transcoding (DVD) 

We have the following choices:

Format chosen 			Default directory to store the generated file(s)

-> 264-high			/dvdrip/DVD 		
-> ISO				/dvdrip/ISO	
-> h264-low                     /dvdrip/transcode 
-> MKV                          /dvdrip/transcode 
-> vobcopy                      /dvdrip/vobcopy  
-> mpeg2                        /dvdrip/transcode    
-> iPhone                       /dvdrip/portable/ip
-> PSP                          /dvdrip/portable/PSP

What format you chose is up to you .....

If you like a 1:1 copy select ISO
If you wish a high quality take h264-high
If the rip should be very fast take h264-low
If you like to watch a DVD with Hubble telescope resolution use PSP :-) 
 
By default I set the transcode profile to h264-high. The longest track will be 
ripped or transcoded automatic. 

The default languages and subtitles are defined from the addon-settings.
You can chose up to 2 audio-languages and 1 subtitle.

3. Expert Mode
--------------

TBC

4. Job Control
--------------

TBC

5. Exit
-------
Will exit the addon


6.6 User-Functions (up to 9 shell-scripts) 
------------------------------------------

With the release of 0.6.15 a user can integrate up to 9 shell scripts into the 
addon.There are a lot of issues that can be resolved with user scripts.

Some possible actions than can be made with this integration.

- Start & Stop a VPN connection
- Copy files to a NAS location 
- Running modified transcoding-scripts.

All user scripts called user1.sh to user9.sh must be placed inside 

~/swiss.army.knife 

Every user-script needs a description-file (user1.desc to user9.desc)

user@xbmcdev:~/swiss.army.knife$ cat user1.desc 
vpn connection on
user@xbmcdev:~/swiss.army.knife$ 

Both files for every shell-script have to exist or the menu option will not be 
activated.
